I've been feeding the let it bee paper into gpt4 section by section and getting it to try to do it in pytorch. https://archives.ismir.net/ismir2015/paper/000013.pdf and ive been showing it some of this code since the equations are garbled when you convert them to text - https://github.com/ctralie/LetItBee/blob/master/NMF.py


to be completely honest im not very hopeful about this approach but it's been a fun distraction
